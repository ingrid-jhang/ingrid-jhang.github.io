    <h1>Identity n Values</h1>
    
    <br>
    <h2 class="big-heading">My values and identity</h2>
       <p>
        I have my life around 23 years in Taiwan since I was born. I don't think I had ever thought about who I was and what my values were back in that time. In the framework of Asian societies, 
       sometimes people don't want to be different from others.</br> Luckily, I have a such cool mother who gives me so much freedom(aka never ask her permission ❛︣ ͜ʖ ❛᷅) to have my adventures.
       I've been living between Australia and New Zealand since 2016, but I've only started thinking about identity and values these recent years.
       </br>My life oversea started as a backpacker to a resident, it's such a huge change in my life. From the people have met these years I found the values of respect, uniqueness,
       and courage to be extremely valuable.

    <h3 class="big-heading">My strengths</h3>
        <p>
        Being positive, createtive and focusing on my own progress. Also, being curious about what I am learning.</br> I always want to improve myself and learn something new but I know it needs to be 
        something I'm interested in and curious about. Programming is one of the things I'd love to try. I know it's hard to learn, but I'm excited about it. My strengths will lead me to achieve my goals.
        </p>
  <br>
    <h4 class="big-heading">Limitations of my learning</h4>
        <p>
          Since I left Taiwan, I've only worked physical labor jobs in warehouses, and factories, even on the farm with people from various countries (The coolest experience). 
          I have always doubted myself if I still can do something more, something I want to achieve or study.
          Deeply in my mind, there are many aspects of limitations that affect me, such as language barriers, cultural barriers self-criticism. But I know that despite these challenges, I'll do my best to overcome them.
