    <h2 class="big-heading">My values and identity :</h2>
    <br>
       <p>
        I have my life around 23 years in Taiwan since I was born. I don't think I had ever thought about who I was and what my values were back in that time. In the framework of Asian societies, 
       sometimes people don't want to be different from others.</br> Luckily, I have a such cool mother who gives me so much freedom(aka never ask her permission) to have my adventures.
       I've been living in Australia and New Zealand since 2016, but I've only started thinking about identity and values these recent years.
       </br>My life oversea started as a backpacker to an immigrant, it's such a huge change in my life. From the people I have met in these years, I found the values of respect, uniqueness, and courage extremely valuable.
       </p>
       
  <br>
    <h2 class="big-heading">My strengths :</h2>
    <br>
        <p>
        Being positive, creative, and focusing on my own progress. Also, being curious about what I am learning.</br> I always want to improve myself and learn something new, but I know it needs to be 
        something I'm interested in and curious about. Programming is one of the things I'd love to try. I know it's hard to learn, but I'm excited about it. I believe that my strengths will lead me to achieve my goals.
        </p>
  <br>
    <h2 class="big-heading">Limitations of my learning :</h2>
    <br>
        <p>
          Since I left Taiwan, I've only worked physical labour jobs in warehouses, and factories, even on the farm with people from various countries (The coolest experience). I have always doubted whether I can still do something more,
           something I want to achieve or study. Deeply in my mind, there are many aspects of limitations that affect me, such as language barriers, cultural barriers, and self-criticism. Despite these challenges, I know I'll do my best to overcome them.
