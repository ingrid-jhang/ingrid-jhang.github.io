  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <section class="about-me-article">
    <br>
    <h2 class="big-heading">A time I was blocked on a simple problem..</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The simple problems happen a lot to me when I code, I think they're about typos or brackets issues. It could take
      me a while to realise there is nothing wrong with the structure of my code but the silly typos. By Improving the
      process with reflection, I try to slow down a bit and look back at what I just write. This helps me to be more
      aware of this little mistake.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="big-heading">A time I elegantly solved a problem..</h2>
    <br>
    <p>When I was doing the FizzBuzz challenge, the code I wrote surprisingly went smoothly. But there was an error
      message that popped up after I finished the Super FizzBuzz challenge, and I realised that I forget to push all the
      elements to the new array. I still remember I was so excited that I just solved the problem in such a short time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="big-heading">How confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>* Pseudocode </strong><br> &nbsp;-I know this should be the first step I should do before I write my code.
      Everything would be much clear. At this point, I still need to improve this skill to break down the task into
      smaller pieces.
      <br><br><strong>* Trying something </strong><br>&nbsp;- When my code doesn't work as what I expected, I love to
      try
      different methods to do it. It could be a mess sometimes with the method I don't really familiar with.
      <br><br><strong>* Rubber ducky method </strong><br>&nbsp;- When I do this method, most of the time I am talking to
      myself. And maybe because of this, it only works very limitedly.
      <br><br><strong>* Reading error messages </strong><br>&nbsp;- It's really helpful, it directly points out of where
      the errors are, and it makes me find out the typo mistake quickly.
      <br><br><strong>* Console.logging </strong><br>&nbsp;- I just recently started using it. By using Console.log, It
      helps me to see what my code is doing so far and find out if the result is what I expected.
      <br><br><strong>* Googling </strong><br>&nbsp; - There are so many resources on the internet, so I would say this
      is one of the best ways to solve problems on my own. But sometimes it's difficult to understand the results I get,
      and it easily leads to a rabbit hole.
      <br><br><strong>* Asking your peers for help </strong><br>&nbsp;- I barely use this method. because I can be shy
      to ask for help on public occasions and disturb others' studies sometimes.
      <br><br><strong>* Asking coaches for help </strong><br>&nbsp;- I'm glad that I have this resource. And I'm
      comfortable reaching out to the coaches if I spend too much time on one error.
      <br><br><strong>* Improving your process with reflection </strong><br>&nbsp;- I know I don't want to make the same
      mistakes over and over again, I use reflection to make sure I understand how the code works, instead of just
      jumping to the next challenge.
