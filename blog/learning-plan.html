  <h1><strong>My learning Plan</strong></h1> 
  <section class="about-me-article">
  
    <h2>My long term goal :</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I haven't really set my long-term goals and career pathway yet. Now I want to try various new things to discover what I am passionate about and build it into my permanent career.
       Developing software is the only thing I want to focus on.
       I found it interesting and I'm excited to be in a group with intelligent people.
    </p>
      <br>
  <h2>My strengths and limitations in learning :</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    It's been a while since I studied a professional project. I need to start exercising my brain again and get used to student life. Because I'm studying remotely, it's easy to be disturbed. But I know if there is something I'm passionate about,
     I will put tons of effort into it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>The skills I want to develop :</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I want to develop better communication skills and have more flexibility, creativity, and self-confidence. I have always admired creative people and it's very important to me as well, I'd love to see myself break through self-limitation in the learning journey.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>My management of the workload :</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I get up at the same time and start my learning routine every day, I usually take a break every 20 minutes to let my brain and eyes get some rest. In the afternoon, go for an hour's walk to get some fresh air and exercise. In a group, we need to respect the 
    differences with others, be kind and understand everyone is on their own learning journey, and it's also important to be kind to yourself.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Seeking help :</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    With the technical problem which I can't solve myself, I will seek help from the facilitators and others on Discord. And if I feel I need to talk to someone,
     I know I have my friends and family there for me.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>What you expect from the Facilitation team :</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I expect that the facilitation team will guide us and be supportive on this difficult learning journey.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Scheduling information :</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    DevAcademy is my only commitment now.
